### Passive Stereo Camera Distance Measurement

"The use of passive stereo camera to reconstruct depth for a very large distance application"

### Dataset Generation
For distance measurement, there are no public datasets available. So, we have created the dataset for testing 
the model we will be using in this project.

Here are the camera settings for this dataset.
```text
f = 1.8nm
```

Two objects, a lock and cup are placed at 40 and 50cm with left and right images.


### Milestone 1
The 1st milestone was the following points:
1. Arrange a dataset to test the model, ( left side, right side images of the objects)
2. Data Pre-processing (remove noise, enhance images, and prepare for model)
3. Buy two cameras to set for the stereo calibration (Logitech C270) 
4. A GitHub repo is created where these data and descriptions uploaded
